# INSTALL WITH CARTHAGE
 
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.
 
 You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:
 
```bash
 $ brew update
 $ brew install carthage
```
- To integrate DIFFQR into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:
 
```ogdl
 github "life4coding/DIFFQR" ~> 1.0
```
Run 'carthage update' to build the framework and drag the built 'QRKit.framework' into your Xcode project.
